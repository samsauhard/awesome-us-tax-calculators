### Standard Deductions 2026

| Filing Status | Standard Deduction |
|---|---|
| Single | $15,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $30,000 |
| Head of Household | $22,500 |

### FICA Tax Rates 2026

- **Social Security Tax:** 6.2% (employee) + 6.2% (employer) up to $176,100 wage base
- **Medicare Tax:** 1.45% (employee) + 1.45% (employer), no cap

```
Taxable Income = Gross Income - Adjustments - Standard/Itemized Deductions

Federal Income Tax = Σ(bracket_rate × income_in_bracket)

Effective Tax Rate = Federal Income Tax / Gross Income × 100

After-Tax Income = Gross Income - Federal Tax - State Tax - FICA
```

### Python: Federal Tax Calculation Snippet

```python
def calculate_federal_tax(taxable_income: float, filing_status: str = "single") -> float:
    """
    Calculate 2026 US federal income tax using marginal brackets.
    Source: IRS Rev. Proc. 2025-38
    """
    brackets_single = [
        (11925,    0.10),
        (48475,    0.12),
        (103350,   0.22),
        (197300,   0.24),
        (250525,   0.32),
        (626350,   0.35),
        (float('inf'), 0.37),
    ]
    tax = 0.0
    prev_limit = 0
    for limit, rate in brackets_single:
        if taxable_income <= prev_limit:
            break
        taxable_at_rate = min(taxable_income, limit) - prev_limit
        tax += taxable_at_rate * rate
        prev_limit = limit
    return round(tax, 2)

# Example
gross = 85_000
standard_deduction = 15_000  # Single, 2026
taxable = gross - standard_deduction
federal_tax = calculate_federal_tax(taxable)
print(f"Federal Tax: ${federal_tax:,.2f}")
print(f"Effective Rate: {federal_tax / gross * 100:.1f}%")
```

### JavaScript: FICA Calculator

```javascript
function calculateFICA(grossWage) {
  const SS_WAGE_BASE = 176100;  // 2026
  const SS_RATE = 0.062;
  const MEDICARE_RATE = 0.0145;
  const ADDL_MEDICARE_THRESHOLD = 200000;
  const ADDL_MEDICARE_RATE = 0.009;

  const socialSecurity = Math.min(grossWage, SS_WAGE_BASE) * SS_RATE;
  const medicare = grossWage * MEDICARE_RATE;
  const additionalMedicare = grossWage > ADDL_MEDICARE_THRESHOLD
    ? (grossWage - ADDL_MEDICARE_THRESHOLD) * ADDL_MEDICARE_RATE
    : 0;

  return {
    socialSecurity: socialSecurity.toFixed(2),
    medicare: (medicare + additionalMedicare).toFixed(2),
    total: (socialSecurity + medicare + additionalMedicare).toFixed(2),
  };
}
```

## Self-Employed & Freelancer Tax

### Self-Employment Tax Formula

```
Net Self-Employment Income = Gross Business Income - Business Expenses

SE Tax Base = Net SE Income × 0.9235  (IRS allows 7.65% deduction)

SE Tax = SE Tax Base × 0.153  (up to SS wage base)
       + SE Tax Base × 0.029  (above SS wage base, Medicare only)

Deductible SE Tax = SE Tax × 0.5  (deducted from gross income, Line 15)

Taxable Income = Gross Income - Deductible SE Tax - Standard Deduction
```

### Quarterly Estimated Tax Due Dates 2026

| Payment | Period | Due Date |

| Q1 | Jan 1 – Mar 31 | April 15, 2026 |
